# OverTime
OverTime

An ImageJ plugin to add timestamps to image stacks with flexible display options and time formats. Creates Overlay timestamps directly from the image calibration and can create RGB images from the current view for use outside of ImageJ.

Put the .jar file in Fiji.app/jars/ and restart Fiji to add it to the Image/Hyperstacks menu.
